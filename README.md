# FundamentalsRobot
Reference Design Robot PCB for Oklahoma Christian University's Introductory E.C.E. Course, Fundamentals.
This design is meant to guide you in designing the schematic and possibly give some general layout tips.

# Things To Note
This design is not intended to be manufactured. This was achieved using surface mount resistors, capacitors, and screw terminals that the school does not have.
Over the few lessons we will do, we will build a board that uses components the school does have and, that if you so wish could be manufactured.
